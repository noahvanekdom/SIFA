                <h3>A Meaningful Working Vacation</h3>
                <p>If you're a medical provider, we hope you will consider volunteering for one to two weeks in exchange for free lodging on Swan's Island.</p>
                <p>Read below for more information about the Swan's Island First Aid program, available dates, and the application process.</p>

                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>The purpose of SIFA is to ensure that the Swan's Island community has access to a licensed medical provider for urgent medical problems during the busiest summer months.</p>
                <p>Visiting licensed medical providers (MDs, DOs, NPs and PAs) will address minor injuries and illnesses at our free walk-in first aid station which serves the local year-round community, summer residents, and visitors. Any more serious or emergent medical issues will be referred to island EMS for potential emergency transport off-island to higher levels of care.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box box--default">
                <h3>Your Role and Commitment</h3>
                <p>Providers will work for 2 hours a day Monday through Friday at our SIFA clinic space. They will also be available 24/7 to support EMS triage. EMS 911 calls are very infrequent (about 50 per year) but occasional medical provider triage will help reduce unnecessary off-island emergency transportation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box box--warning box--centered">
                <h3>What We Provide</h3>
                <p><strong>SIFA will provide free lodging and cover ferry costs</strong> for the medical provider and family for the week(s) that they volunteer. For our SIFA volunteers, practicing community medicine in a beautiful environment while also having time to relax will be an enriching and rejuvenating working vacation.</p>
